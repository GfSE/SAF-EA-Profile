# SLV02a Physical Internal Exchange VP

## Purpose
The Physical Internal Exchange Viewpoint serves for the identification and definition of interfaces of elements of the physical system. also, the delegation of system element interfaces to the physical system boundary interfaces is covered. The Physical Internal Exchange Viewpoint
* identifies system element interfaces on a physical level
* states to which other physical elements the interfaces are connected to
* assigns physical interface definitions to interfaces
* defines the usage of interfaces, e.g., if only a subset of the interfaces is used
* defines the delegation of physical system element interfaces to physical system boundary interfaces
