# SLV02a Logical Internal Exchange VP

## Purpose
The Logical Internal Exchange Viewpoint serves for the identification and definition of interfaces of elements of the logical system. also, the delegation of system element interfaces to the logical system boundary interfaces is covered. The Logical Internal Exchange Viewpoint
* identifies system element interfaces on a logical level
* states to which other logical elements the interfaces are connected to
* assigns conceptual interface definitions to interfaces
* defines the usage of interfaces, e.g., if only a subset of the interfaces is used
* defines the delegation of logical system element interfaces to the logical system boundary interfaces
