# SLV02a Logical Structure Definition VP

## Purpose
The Logical Structure Viewpoint describes how the system is decomposed into a hierarchical structure of logical elements responsible for different system functions (divide & conquer principle). It covers related logical concepts and principles that support the logical operation of the system and is widely reusable among similar systems like product families, or product generations.
