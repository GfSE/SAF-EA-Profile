# SPV01b Physical Context Definition VP

## Purpose
The Physical Context Definition Viewpoint identifies the various contexts the SOI is used in, along with the associated external entities sharing a physical interface with the system. For each context, the applicable environmental conditions shall be defined. The physical context helps identify the interface requirements needed to integrate a system into its environment in a given context.
