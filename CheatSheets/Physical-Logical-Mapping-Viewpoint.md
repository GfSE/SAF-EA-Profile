# SPV08a Physical Logical Mapping VP

## Purpose
The Physical Logical Mapping Viewpoint supports the definition of the assignment of conceptual logical system elements to physical SOI elements.
Following the identification of physical SOI elements capable of performing the system functions of logical elements, the Physical Logical Mapping Viewpoint provides feedback to the System Architecture Definition process to consolidate or confirm the allocation, partitioning, and alignment of logical elements to physical elements that comprise the SOI.
