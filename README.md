# Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect Repository
The repository features the EA **SAF Profile** as MDG Technology with supplemental material. The **SAF Profile** is intended to be used with EA 16 and EA’s SysML1.5 MDG.

## safMDG.xml
**SAF Profile** has been created by the System Architecture Framework Working Group of the German Chapter of INCOSE, GfSE e.V. The SAF Profile provides the stereotypes, specification views and linking rules according to the [SAF-Specification](https://github.com/GfSE/SAF-Specification/tree/TdSE2023) based on EA's MDG Technology.

Note: SQL queries to support mapping viewpoints (SOV8 – SPV08 in aspect 8 mapping and cross references) will be available soon.
