System Architecture Framework Profile has been created by the SAF Working Group of the German Chapter of INCOSE (GfSE). The SAF Profile provides the stereotypes, specification views and linking rules according to the [SAF-Specification](https://github.com/GfSE/SAF-Specification/tree/TdSE2023) based on EA's MDG Technology.
SQL queries to support mapping viewpoints (SOV8 – SPV08 in aspect 8 mapping and cross references) will be available soon.
